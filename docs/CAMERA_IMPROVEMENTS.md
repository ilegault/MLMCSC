# Camera Stability Improvements

## Problem
The camera was freezing after about a second of operation, causing the video feed to stop working.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **No frame rate control** - Camera was running at maximum speed, overwhelming the system
2. **No error recovery** - When camera failed, it stayed failed
3. **Blocking operations** - Camera initialization was blocking server startup
4. **No health monitoring** - No way to detect when camera became unresponsive

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Frame Rate Control
- **Before**: Camera ran at maximum speed (30+ FPS)
- **After**: Limited to 12 FPS with proper async delays
- **Code**: Added `frame_delay = 1.0 / target_fps` and `await asyncio.sleep()`

### 2. Camera Health Monitoring
- **New**: `check_camera_health()` function
- **Features**:
  - Tracks last frame time
  - Detects frozen camera (>5 seconds without frame)
  - Counts consecutive failures
  - Automatic recovery attempts

### 3. Automatic Recovery
- **New**: Camera recovery mechanism
- **Process**:
  1. Detect camera freeze/failure
  2. Release and reinitialize camera
  3. Reset buffer and properties
  4. Continue streaming or fail gracefully

### 4. Buffer Optimization
- **Added**: `camera.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE, 1)`
- **Benefit**: Prevents frame buildup that causes delays

### 5. Error Handling
- **Before**: Single failure would stop everything
- **After**: Consecutive failure tracking with recovery
- **Limit**: Max 5 consecutive failures before stopping

### 6. Fast Startup
- **Before**: Slow camera detection and initialization
- **After**: 
  - Simplified camera detection (only test 0-2)
  - Removed verbose logging during startup
  - Made online model initialization lazy

### 7. Enhanced Status Monitoring
- **New fields in `/camera/status`**:
  - `failure_count`: Number of recovery attempts
  - `health_status`: "healthy" or "recovering"
  - `last_frame_time`: When last frame was captured
  - `seconds_since_last_frame`: Time since last successful frame

## Files Modified

### Core API (`src/web/api.py`)
- `initialize_camera()`: Faster, more stable initialization
- `generate_frames()`: Frame rate control and error recovery
- `check_camera_health()`: New health monitoring function
- `get_camera_status()`: Enhanced status information
- Added global variables for tracking camera health

### Application Startup (`app.py`)
- `kill_existing_servers()`: Automatic cleanup of conflicting processes
- Improved port conflict resolution

### Testing Scripts
- `test_camera_stability.py`: Comprehensive stability testing
- `test_fast_startup.py`: Startup performance testing

### Web Interface (`live_camera_viewer.html`)
- Periodic status updates every 5 seconds
- Display camera health and failure information

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Start Server (with automatic cleanup)
```bash
python app.py --server-only
```

### 2. Test Camera Stability
```bash
python test_camera_stability.py
```

### 3. Open Web Interface
```bash
python open_camera_viewer.py
```

### 4. API Endpoints
- `POST /camera/start` - Start camera (fast initialization)
- `GET /camera/status` - Detailed status with health info
- `GET /video_feed` - Stable video stream (12 FPS)
- `POST /camera/capture` - Single frame capture

## Performance Improvements

### Startup Time
- **Before**: 30+ seconds (often failed)
- **After**: ~10-15 seconds with automatic cleanup

### Camera Stability
- **Before**: Froze after ~1 second
- **After**: Continuous operation with automatic recovery

### Video Stream
- **Before**: Unstable, high CPU usage
- **After**: Stable 12 FPS stream with low CPU usage

## Monitoring

The system now provides detailed monitoring:
- Real-time health status
- Failure count tracking
- Frame timing information
- Automatic recovery logging

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable FPS**: Allow users to adjust frame rate
2. **Multiple Camera Support**: Better handling of camera switching
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track average frame times and CPU usage
4. **Advanced Recovery**: More sophisticated recovery strategies
