# Live Microscope Integration - Complete! ✅

## What Was Done

Your live microscope functionality has been **successfully integrated** into your main `app.py`. You now have a unified server that includes everything.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated `app.py`
- ✅ Added comprehensive startup information showing all live microscope features
- ✅ Enhanced server startup messaging to include camera endpoints
- ✅ Updated launcher to show "Live Microscope" in the title
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

### 2. Camera Endpoints Already Available
Your `src/web/api.py` already had all the camera endpoints implemented:
- ✅ `/video_feed` - Live video streaming
- ✅ `/camera/start` - Start camera
- ✅ `/camera/stop` - Stop camera  
- ✅ `/camera/status` - Camera status
- ✅ `/camera/capture` - Capture frames
- ✅ `/camera/predict_live` - Live predictions
- ✅ `/camera/detect` - Detect available cameras

### 3. Created Helper Files
- ✅ `start_integrated_server.py` - Simple startup script
- ✅ `test_integration.py` - Test all functionality
- ✅ `INTEGRATED_MICROSCOPE_GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide
- ✅ Updated `demo_live_microscope.py` to use correct server address

## How to Use Your Integrated System

### Start the Server
```bash
# Option 1: Interactive launcher
python app.py

# Option 2: Direct start
python app.py --server-only


### Test Everything Works
```bash
python test_integration.py
```
